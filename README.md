# Breadth-First-Search
Finds the shortest path from one node to another in an undirected graph with linear O(n) running time.


This is an implementation of the Breadth First Search algorithm. It explores the nodes of a graph in layers, in order to find the shortest path between given vertices. The output is the fewest no. of edges from starting vertex to target vertex.
