# Breadth-First-Search
Finds the shortest path from one node to another in an undirected graph with linear O(n+m) running time. (n=no. of nodes, m=no. of edges)


This is an implementation of the Breadth First Search algorithm. It explores the nodes of a graph in layers, in order to find the shortest path between given vertices. The output is the fewest no. of edges from starting vertex to target vertex.
